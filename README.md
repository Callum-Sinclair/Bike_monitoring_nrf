# Bike Performance Monitoring using Android Phone and nRF chips

A complete bike monitoring system including the following modules:
- Speed
- Cadence
- Heart Rate
- Power
- Distance to following vehicle - Ultra sonic ranger (USR)
- Temparature
- Gradient

Each module will be run using an nRF51 chip, interfacing with a hub (nRF52), which will communicate with an andriod smartphone using BLE.

This repo contains all code for the sensors and hub, our app is available on bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/account/signin/?next=/lukacstomi91/smartbike/commits/branch/master

This project is being undertaken as part of my Electronics and Electrical Engineering MEng degree at the University of Glasgow, along with 3 others.

# System overview

All modules connect to each other via BLE, with the network looking like this:

Phone   <-BLE->    Hub


Hub     <-I2C->    Temparature, Gradient

Hub     <-ADC->    Heart Rate

Hub     <-BLE->    Speed

Hub     <-BLE->    USR

Hub     <-BLE->    Cadence  <-BLE->   Force


Each module has further details in a readme file in each sub-folder

# BLE packet types used

To simplify the BLE communication, and reduce on-air packages, the following BLE characteristics
are used to communicate between the Hub and Phone.

| Data	        |Data range (all int)	        | size	    | Packaged in|
| ------------- |------------------------------ | -------   | ---------------|
| Speed	        | 0-500 (wheel rpm)             | uint16	| cscs measurement, last wheel event time |
