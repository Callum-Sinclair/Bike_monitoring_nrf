# Bike Performance Monitoring using Android Phone and nRF chips

A complete bike monitoring system including the following modules:
- Speed
- Cadence
- Heart Rate
- Power
- Distance to following vehicle
- Temparature
- Gradient

Each module will be run using an nRF51 chip, interfacing with a hub (nRF52), which will communicate with an andriod smartphone using BLE, pairing using NFC.

This repo contains all code for the sensors and hub.

This project is being undertaken as part of my Electronics and Electrical Engineering MEng degree at the University of Glasgow, along with 3 others.
