# Cadence

This module measures the cyclist's cadence.  The hardware uses a reed switch connected to
a GPIO pin on the nRF51 chip, and a magnet attached to the pedal's crank.

The code uses PPI connections between the GPIO pin and a counter to implement the counting
of revolutions fully in hardware, thereby reducing power consumption.

This module connects to the Hub, and sends battery and cadence information to the hub.

This module also connects to the Force sensor and using the force and cadence values approximates
the input power, this is then communicated to the hub (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

The packet types used are:
Cadence,        CSC measurement - cumulative crank revs
Battery,        CSC measurement - last crank event time
Power,          RSC mearurement - inst speed
Power Battery,  RSC measruememt - inst cadence
